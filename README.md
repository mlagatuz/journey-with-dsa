I will discuss my technical interview thoughts and document the learning journey for myself.

Recently, I was asked a question about "Trie". As the interviewer was explaining the question on the whiteboard, I recognized the algorithm which could be used is a "Trie". I decided to code up my answer after the interview. It's not complete at the moment, but it will be a work in progress, while I continue to learn, code, and practice.
